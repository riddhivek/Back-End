JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a dynamic, weakly typed language that supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles.

JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it is executed by the web browser to create interactive web pages. It is responsible for handling user interactions, such as button clicks, form submissions, and dynamic content updates, without requiring a page reload.

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page. This allows JavaScript to modify the appearance and behavior of a web page, such as changing the text, images, and layout, in response to user actions or other events.

JavaScript is also used for server-side scripting, where it runs on a web server to generate dynamic content or process user requests. Node.js is a popular runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be executed outside of a web browser, allowing developers to build web applications, APIs, and other server-side applications using JavaScript.

In summary, JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is widely used for creating interactive web pages and server-side applications. Its popularity stems from its ease of use, cross-platform compatibility, and wide range of libraries and frameworks available for building complex web applications.
