Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable network applications.

Node.js is widely used for developing web servers, networking applications, and real-time applications such as chat and streaming services. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require high concurrency and real-time processing.

Node.js has a large and active community, with a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules available for various tasks and integrations. This makes it easy for developers to build complex applications quickly and efficiently.
